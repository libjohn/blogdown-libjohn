As a Data Science Librarian/Consultant in the [**Center for Data & Visualization Sciences**](//library.duke.edu/data), I help Duke University students and researchers navigate practical data science challenges.  To that end I provide a series of *workshops* on *R*; offer walk-in and by-appointment consultations; and host the *R we having fun yet* learning series ([**Rfun**](//rfun.library.duke.edu/)). 

My [workshops](#workshops) and presentations focus on using **R** as a **data-first** coding language via the **Tidyverse** dialect, Reproducibility and tidy data, Text mining and sentiment analysis, APIs, web scraping, data parsing, data cleaning, and data visualization. Each workshop is designed as a hands-on experience where you can download  practice data, presentation slides, and workbook guides.  Recorded [video streaming](https://youtube.com/johnlittle1) is often available.
