I host an R learning series, [Rfun](https://rfun.library.duke.edu), or _R we having fun yet_‽ You can find code, guides, slides, video, practice data, and more.

**_Rfun_** is a sub-brand of workshops hosted by the [CDVS](https://library.duke.edu/data/). For a complete schedule of all upcoming workshops see the Center for Data & Visualization's [Upcoming Workshops ](https://library.duke.edu/data/workshops).
