## Brief "History"

- 1950s:  American mathematician Stephen Cole Kleene 

- Came into common use with Unix text-processing

- Consists of different syntaxes (POSIX, Perl)

---

## Implementations

- Search engines, word processors, text editors

- AWK, grep (UNIX command line)

- Textpad, Notepad++

- Google Sheets

- MS Word

- OpenRefine

- Programming languages: often built, sometimes via  libraries

---

## Patterns

- Syntax for representing a pattern

- Each characters in a regex is either a **metacharacter** (special meaning)

--

- Or, a **regular character** (literal meaning)

--

&gt; Duke.

- The wildcard '.' matches every character except a newline

--

    - Matches:  "Duke ", "Dukes", "Duke1", "Duke0", ...
    - Note the space following "Duke"
    - Not "duke" or "dukes"

--

- You can "escape" a metacharacter to enforce a literal match

&gt; \\.

---

## Matches

- Range from precise to general

- General:  `[a-z]`  matches all letters from 'a' to 'z'

--

- More general:  `.`

--

- More precise:  `j`

--

- Common regex used to locate same word spelled two different ways

    - match "color" and "colour"
    
--
    
        - `/colou?r/` 
    
--

    - match "color" and "Color"
    
        - `/[Cc]olor/`

## Find and Replace

- Most people have used regex and didn't know it

- Exist in Word Processors as "find &amp; replace"

- Sometimes it's used to find:  match a pattern

- Sometimes it's used to replace:  substitute

---

## Uses

- Can get very sophisticated, matching for complex substitutions

    - For Example capture (find)
        - \#hastags (words that begin with "#")
        - all email addresses
        - variant spellings
        - variant capitalizations
        - variant puntuations

- But ...

--

## Regex *is not* Machine Learning

- *You* specify the pattern

- This is sometimes challenging
